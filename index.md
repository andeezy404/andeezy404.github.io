## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs  

* <i>Lab 03, Part-01 </i>

    This lab was my favorite and the most interesting, frankly because the operands and
operators that C++ uses are quite differently written on paper, C++ structure maps the difference between C++ and traditional writing and programming. Giving the same answers, in other words, “returns” the answer, but written differently. A very early lab in my CS labs, comprises all functions, operands, operators and arithmetic functions, reading the persons input, and outputting an answer. This lab was heavy on math and science, considering that to find the Basal Metabolic Rate of women and men are different due to mass, and other biological factors that are foretaken in the equations and program. To take this into account, once compiled, the program asks for age, height in inches, and weight in pounds. It executes the equation by adding, multiplying and dividing by constants in the BMR formula, giving the results for both men and women. The Basal Metabolic Rate is a perfect formula for those who are looking to maintain or lose weight. As it is different for both men and women, the equation considers both and fulfilling an answer for both.  

* <i>Lab 11, Part–02 </i> 

This lab was another of my favorites due to statements and loops that were used. The game was composed of if statements and while loops that determined whether a player's guess was too high or too low to the random number generated.  This lab helped understand that although using functions call RNG, it's not so much as these numbers have to be programmed in to allow the program to have a number set and allow the player to guess.  The program is a seemingly fun program to execute that determines the number of guesses left by the player and if their guess is too high, low, correct or wrong. My favorite statement so far in this lab was the bool statements used to determine true or false in the guess and outputting, wrong, correct and how many guesses.
